PROJECT SETUP AND INITIALIZATION
================================================================================

Date: 2024-12-19
Time: 18:55:00 - 18:58:00 PST
Developer: AI Assistant
Task: Initial repository setup and application launch

SUMMARY:
Successfully imported and configured the Battleship AI Research Platform from 
GitHub repository (abk999-cmyk/battleship). All dependencies installed, 
applications tested, and platform is fully operational.

ACTIONS PERFORMED:
1. ✅ Repository Clone
   - Source: https://github.com/abk999-cmyk/battleship.git
   - Target: /Users/abhinav/Desktop/Personal Projects/Battleship
   - Status: 76 objects cloned successfully

2. ✅ Project Analysis
   - Analyzed README.md: Comprehensive AI research platform
   - Reviewed requirements.txt: 11 core dependencies identified
   - Examined main.py: CLI interface for batch testing and game watching
   - Studied setup.py: Automated installation and configuration script

3. ✅ Dependencies Installation
   - Python Version: 3.9 (Compatible ✓)
   - Core Libraries Installed:
     * numpy>=1.19.0 ✓
     * pandas>=1.1.0 ✓
     * matplotlib>=3.3.0 ✓
     * seaborn>=0.11.0 ✓
     * scipy>=1.5.0 ✓
     * networkx>=2.5.0 ✓
     * tensorflow==2.17.0 ✓
     * scikit-learn>=0.24.0 ✓
     * pillow>=8.0.0 ✓
     * customtkinter>=4.6.0 ✓
     * tqdm>=4.50.0 ✓

4. ✅ Project Structure Setup
   - Created directories: data/, logs/, reports/
   - Generated game assets: water.png, ship.png, hit.png, miss.png
   - Created launch script: launch_battleship.sh (executable)

5. ✅ Application Testing
   - Dashboard GUI: Launched successfully (running in background)
   - CLI Interface: Tested game simulation (MainAI vs UltimateBattleshipAgent)
   - Test Result: MainAI won in 31 turns
   - Log files generated: dashboard.log, ai_agent3.log

CURRENT PROJECT STATUS:
- ✅ Repository: Successfully cloned and configured
- ✅ Dependencies: All packages installed and tested
- ✅ Applications: Dashboard and CLI both operational
- ✅ Assets: Game graphics generated and ready
- ✅ Launch Scripts: Available for easy startup

AVAILABLE INTERFACES:

1. **Primary Dashboard (Recommended)**
   Command: python3 battleship_dashboard.py
   OR: ./launch_battleship.sh
   Features: GUI with Game, Batch Simulation, Analytics, Settings tabs

2. **Command Line Interface**
   Command: python3 main.py [options]
   Options:
   - --watch: Watch a single game with visual output
   - --opp [opponent]: Choose opponent (ultimate, naive1-naive10)
   - --delay [seconds]: Adjust turn speed for watching
   - --games [number]: Set number of games for batch testing

3. **Training Scripts**
   - python3 train_heatmap.py: Train neural heatmap models
   - python3 meta_learner.py: Run meta-learning optimization
