## Dashboard and Webapp Components

### Research dashboard (`apps/battleship_dashboard.py`)
- Tk-based multi-tab app: Game (AI vs AI), Batch Simulation, Analytics, Play vs AI.
- Rendering via `BoardCanvas` with ship/hit/miss overlays; optional probability heatmap overlay by querying agent probability grids in real time.
- Game engine manages turns, logs moves and metadata, triggers learning hooks, and updates batch stats. Analytics views aggregate `all_moves.csv` and per-game JSONs.
- Rich error handling and thread-safe UI updates; matplotlib uses Agg backend to avoid threading issues.

### Legacy UIs
- `apps/battleship_app.py`: compact AI-vs-AI simulator for side-by-side boards; logs metrics to `game_logs/`.
- `apps/battleship_app_play.py`: human vs AI play with telemetry logger; optionally background-learns from Parquet logs if pandas/pyarrow available.

### Webapp folder
- `battleship-webapp/` contains scaffolding for a separate web interface (backend, static assets, logs, data). This repoâ€™s primary maintained interface is the Tk dashboard; the webapp folder is not wired into the current Python entry points.

### Assets
- `assets/` auto-generated by `scripts/setup.py` if missing: `water.png`, `ship.png`, `hit.png`, `miss.png` for improved visuals.
